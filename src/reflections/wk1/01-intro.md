# Gettin Git

## Answer the following questions

## In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git because it allows us to work with multiple developers on code without overlapping or messing up each other's code due to having access to our own local server, then uploading our code to a central server to share with other developers.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

With multiple branches it allows you to have several parallel developments at once.

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a control system that allows you keep track of your code, whereas GitHub is a place for you to store your repositories and keep them in one place.
