# What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing is used to layout a page exactly how the stakeholders, designers, or client wants the page to look before the developer builds the code to make the page what it is.

# What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The three levels of wire-framing are low, mid, and high fidelity. Each one is useful for many reasons. Low is useful for the early stages of design, used as sort of a chopping block, very rough draft showing layout. Mid is useful for the designers to place image and text holders to show what the potential build could look like. Where as high fidelity is used to build a full site, broken down to actual pixel size, and full text/image placed. Each serves its own purpose and they are all equally important throughout the planning and development phase.

# Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Absolutely. Wire-framing is not only useful for the developer, but also the client, stakeholder, and designers can all contribute to the overall idea. While it can be a challenge to plan and develop from paper to a fully high fidelity finish it allows the developer and design team to collaborate and bring a vision to life.
