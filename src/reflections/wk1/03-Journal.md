# What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I like the tip when using small icons, add a shape around the smaller icon to fill the void that a larger icon would fix. It gives it a bit of color difference, and makes it look a bit classier, instead of just a chunky icon that anyone could throw on a page.

# Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

The icon with a shape around it is definitely one resource I plan to utilize. Another resource is the box shadow around boxes or cards to make them have a bit of a shadow, but not one that makes it look clunky and out of place.

# How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

In my personal experience if a site isn't well put together, or lacks even slight design, I believe it shows a lack of care, or creativity on the company's behalf.
