# Understanding CSS

## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

The pseudo class is used to declare a variable or element without defining it within the code. example: :root var=--primary

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is used to rule one item if multiple rules are targeting the same element property.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you over use important too many times you could be declaring multiple rules with the same feature cancelling each other out.
