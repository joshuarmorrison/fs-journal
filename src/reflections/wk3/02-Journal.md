## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is bundling data and the methods that act on that data such that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle.

## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

The main problem with them was that they were meant to be hidden from the user and used primarily for the backend. When a developer would use them sometimes their properties would be deleted leaving a hidden function to not have a purpose.

## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

with an underscore. You would do this to hide the function or to signify to other devs not to touch the function or its properites.
