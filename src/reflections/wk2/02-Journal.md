# Dysfunctionally functional

# What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

## The three ways to write a function are: the Function Declaration, Function Expressions, and Arrow functions expression. 

## Function expressions aren't hoisted whereas function declaration does.

# What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

## Parameters are used when defining a function. Whereas arguments are the value that the function receives from the parameter.

# What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

## Functions that operate on other functions and take them as arguments, or by returning them. An example would be a greater than function that increases the original function.
