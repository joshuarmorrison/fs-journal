# Mistakes were made

# What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

## Making a plan is necessary so you can visualize your project, and see what you want it to look like. It allows you to avoid just writing code in no order and confusing yourself when you forget the process you are on, or jumping ahead on something that you remembered as opposed to following a plan of execution.

# How do you find answers when you are stuck?

## The best resources are those around you, chances are that someone else has gone through what you have and can help you in seconds vs googling something for hours and not understanding what you are looking at.

# From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

## The biggest takeaways for me are realizing that planning is crucial to executing a good coding session. Knowing when to ask for help versus trying to google a potential solution. Also making sure you are using quality code versus just sloppily using chopped code.
