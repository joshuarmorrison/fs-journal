# Promise meee



## What are the three states of a Promise?

### Pending (this is the initial state, before the Promise succeeds or fails) 

### Resolved (This is the completed Promise)

### Rejected (This is the failed Promise) 

## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

### They are called only once, then have constructors within them to continue the code, but get rid of the callback hell.

## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

### .then is calling .then(success, error) and promise.then(success)


 ### .catch is catching  .catch(error)
